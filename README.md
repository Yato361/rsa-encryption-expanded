# Small description
An algorithm that can encrypt more bytes then the key usually can encrypt. Multithreading is planned.

The typical RSA private key can encrypt a few bytes less than its length. 
This algorithm therefore uses the ability to encrypt and decrypt blocks of bytes in a specific pattern.
As this algorithm is more likely an expand than a manipulation of the RSA encryption.

# Multithreading
It is planned to give this programm a multithreading ability.
