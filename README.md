# Small description
An algorithm that can encrypt more bytes then the key can usually encrypt. MT is planned.

The typical RSA private key can encrypt a few bytes less than its length. 
This algorithm therefore uses the ability to encrypt and decrypt blocks of bytes in a specific pattern.

# Multithreading
It is planned to give this programm a multithreading ability.
